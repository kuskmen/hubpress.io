<p>Hi, this will be my very first blog, so this will be some sort of explanation for its purpose and which audience it targets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am currently <em>junior software developer</em> at <a href="https://www.sbtech.com/">SBTech</a> a company for sports betting, I am 24 years old and I live in Sofia, but enough of me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This blog will be for software development(mostly, I can&#8217;t predict the future) and it will have the purpose of explaining principles and interesting topics I&#8217;ve read in internet or heard from podcasts on my journey to work every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While blogging, except the usuall tags that I will use I will use 5 different more in order for you to understand if this topic is suitable for you or not. They are borrowed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</a> - read it , really good stuff - helped me a lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the examples will be from the <code>.NET framework</code> because this is what technology I am using when I am at work , and this is where I feel most comfortable, but I will try to be language agnostic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you may have guessed by now I am not linguist so please don&#8217;t mind the grammar ;)</p>
